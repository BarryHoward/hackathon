Hackathon Purpose/Goals:

For our eighth weekend project, we were required to create an image sharing app, with Instagram to use as loose inspiration.

We made use of skills from previous weeks including

 * API creation using Adonis--sqlite/Postgres and deployment on Heroku
 * Continued use of Postman to initially test our routes
 * Continued use of Angular, specifically larger scale use of UI-Router
